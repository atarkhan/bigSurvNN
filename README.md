This repository implements our proposed framework for both tabular and imaging datasets, and compare them with the existed methods in the literature. 
Python "main_tabular.py" implements our proposed framework with tabular data. It includes our both regression-based and neural network-based models. Python code "main_mnist.py"
implements our framework with imaging data (here single-channel greyscale images in MNIST dataset).
